# Boilerplate to get contracts deployed on the blockchain

## npm packages used
- dotenv
    - configure .env to include api key and private key.
- hardhat
    - run <code> npm install hardhat --save-dev </code>
    - spin up a hardhat project and configure the hardhat config file
    - use api key and private key from dot env to deploy to the blockchain
- alchemy-sdk

## assets needed
since we use alchemy we'll need the api key from our developer dashboard
we'll also need the private key from our metamask wallet
